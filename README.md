## Description

Based on the Example 3 code, the game adds an "ANGRY MODE" which features several changes to the blob's environment and movement.

---

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

The player can trigger "ANGRY MODE" by pressing the space bar while moving the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. "ANGRY MODE" triggers the previously still platforms to move across the screen. The platforms can also be "smashed in anger" if the blob jumps directly underneath it.
